# Easily adjust the font size in all Emacs frames

This package provides commands for increasing or decreasing the
default font size in all GUI Emacs frames -- it is like an Emacs-wide
version of `text-scale-mode`.

It works by adjusting the height of the `default` face in the
`user` theme, which is always combined with any other loaded
themes.

It's handy for quickly adjusting the font size for readability or
impromptu screen-sharing.

**Note that as of Emacs 29, many users might prefer the built-in `global-text-scale-adjust` system.**

## Installation

Install `default-text-scale` from the [MELPA](http://melpa.org)
repository. The version of `default-text-scale` there will always be
up-to-date.

## Usage

You can then customize/enable the global minor mode
`default-text-scale-mode`, which binds <kbd>C-M-=</kbd> and
<kbd>C-M--</kbd> by default. Alternatively, bind the corresponding
commands yourself as desired.
